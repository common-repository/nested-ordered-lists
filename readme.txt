Add some hierarchy to your nested lists.

== Description ==

When ordered lists are nested, by default each level will have the same style of numbering, but this plugin allows lists nested up to three levels deep to have different styles of number identifiers.

These list styles are also reflected in the visual editor, and to help visualise the nesting hierarchy of ordered lists in the visual editor, a subtle border is shown around lists.

== Installation ==

1. Install just like you would any plugin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the admin page? =

This plugin doesn't have any options, so there is no admin page.
